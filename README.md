You can watch a demo of the app here https://youtu.be/kj3K9pf0mAY

**Built using React.**

Redux was used partialy.

**UI library:** Semantic UI.

## Some other libraries/ api used:

* Google maps API for address and auto-complete.

* Moment.js to convert dates to a freindlier interface.

* Chatkit api for real-time chat (web-sockets).

## Highlights:

* Fast. The api is split up into smaller pieces, so they're loaded only at the time needed. Example: only when clicking to see and envent, is the RSVP loaded.
* Custom carousel with css transitions.
* Responsive design (when using on a mobile device, a message is displayed asking the user to use desktop instead).
